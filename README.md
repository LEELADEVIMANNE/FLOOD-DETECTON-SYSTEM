# FLOOD-DETECTON-SYSTEM
Flood Detection System ‚Äì Project Overview
‚úÖ Objective:To detect potential flood situations using real-time data and provide timely alerts to people and authorities to ensure public safety, property protection, and early preparedness.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components:
Sensors (e.g., water level, rainfall, humidity, pressure sensors):
These collect real-time data from rivers, lakes, or urban drainage systems.

Microcontroller/Processor (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi):
It processes the sensor data and checks if the values cross a flood threshold.

Communication Module (e.g., GSM, Wi-Fi, or LoRa):
Sends alerts (SMS, email, or app notifications) to users and disaster control teams.

Cloud/Data Storage:
Stores historical and current data for monitoring and analysis.

Mobile App / Web Dashboard (optional):
Shows current water levels, flood alerts, and maps of affected areas.

üìä Working Process:
Sensors continuously monitor water levels and rainfall.

Data is sent to the microcontroller for processing.

If the values exceed danger limits, an alert is generated.

Notifications are sent to users, authorities, or displayed on a dashboard.

Authorities can take early actions like evacuation or warning announcements.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used:
Hardware: Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor, GSM Module

Software: C/C++ (Arduino IDE), Python (optional), Firebase (for cloud), MIT App Inventor (for mobile alerts)

Connectivity: GSM/Wi-Fi for alert messages

üí° Benefits:
Early flood detection saves lives.

Prevents loss of property and agriculture.

Helps government and emergency services plan responses.

Affordable and scalable for urban and rural areas.
